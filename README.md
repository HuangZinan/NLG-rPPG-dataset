## 1.Overview
BH-rPPG dataset(stands for Beihang University Remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy) is a dataset consists of 3 lighting conditions with uneven distribution which collected in indoor environment. In order to evaluate the performance of deep learning based rPPG under different lighting conditions, we recruited twelve healthy subjects (11 males and 1 females) on campus, with a  mean age of 32, SD of 2.5.
